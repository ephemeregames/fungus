= Fungus

A Coffeescript 3D Game engine.


= To do
. Web-based unit test framework so we can test the game with the whole stack (i.e. JQuery)
. Web-based editor so we can build the game and see the results live (that would be awesome but so much work)
. Move Clock class from other project to include variable time steps.
. Inherit Vector3 from Three.js
. Move Color class from other project and inherit from Three.js
. Fix CoffeeKup for release version or find another templating engine (pluggable?)
. Handle error when no camera in the scene
